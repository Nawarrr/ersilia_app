<h2 id="model-details"> Model Details</h2>
<ul>
<li>Developed by University of Münster, Germany, 2021.</li>
<li>Multilayer Perceptron and Autoencoder.</li>
<li>Trained to extract Natural Product Score and Natural Product
Fingerprint.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="intended-use"> Intended Use</h2>
<ul>
<li>Intended to encode implicit natural product information while
keeping enough information on the chemical space of those natural
products.</li>
<li>Not intended to do fingerprint-based virtual screening (FBVS).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="factors"> Factors</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fingerprints are built using fragments frequently found in natural
products.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="metrics"> Metrics</h2>
<ul>
<li>Area under the curve (AUC), measures area under receiver operating
characteristics (ROC) curve, it ranges from 0 to 1 while 1 is the
perfect classification.</li>
<li>Enrichment Factor, measures how good active molecules are identified
based on similarity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="recommendation">  Recommendation</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improvement could be achieved by per-training the neural networks on
completely unrelated data, the focus here is on correctly predicting
descriptors and only the final stage models are trained to identify
natural products.</li>
</ul>
</div><div class="column">
<h2 id="training-data"> Training Data</h2>
<ul>
<li>A dataset consisting of natural products and synthetic molecules was
made, the Coconut database [2] was updated and used, synthetic molecules
were in Zinc [3] “in-stock” library.</li>
<li>Synthetic compounds had to have similarity of over 0.5 to assure the
performance of the neural network.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="validation-data">Validation Data</h2>
<ul>
<li>Datasets were collected by Seo et al. [4].</li>
<li>First dataset to differentiate between synthetic and natural
products.</li>
<li>Second dataset to differentiate between active and inactive natural
products</li>
<li>Third dataset is used to combine the use of the other two, to
differentiate between both synthetic and natural and active and
inactive.</li>
</ul>
